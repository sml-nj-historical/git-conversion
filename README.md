# git-conversion
This repository includes [reposurgeon](http://www.catb.org/~esr/reposurgeon/) scripts used to migrate SML/NJ codebase from Subversion to git.

We liberally follow Eric S Raymond's [DVCS migration HOWTO](http://www.catb.org/~esr/reposurgeon/dvcs-migration-guide.html) for this conversion. The scripts are not fully automated _yet_, see `project.lift` file in each directory for additional notes.
